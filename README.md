# üß† AI Prompt Injection & Red Teaming ‚Äì by Eye2on1AI

This repository showcases my manual testing and red teaming work on **Large Language Models (LLMs)** such as GPT-4 and Gemini. It includes real-world examples of **prompt injection**, **jailbreaks**, and **loophole prompts** that explore model vulnerabilities.

---

## üéØ Objective

The purpose of this repo is to document adversarial prompts that:

- Bypass system instructions and safety layers  
- Hijack or override original user context  
- Trigger jailbreak behavior or unrestricted outputs  
- Confuse the model or create logic loops  
- Explore how LLMs respond under adversarial input
